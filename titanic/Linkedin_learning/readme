This is additon to udemy titanic project.
Here I learned to use statistical significance(t-statistic, P-Value) of features with label(Survived) from scipy,
Box Cox transformation to tranform Fare date to normal distribution,
cross validation and parameter tuning on random forest classification model,
And visulising feature Importance through Rf feature importance parameter.
